# Matplotlib-challenge

In this analysis, we explore the effectiveness of various drug regimens in reducing tumor volumes in mice, with a specific focus on Capomulin. The investigation involves comprehensive data cleaning, summary statistics calculation, and visualization to provide information into the treatment outcomes.

Using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scipy, the analysis covers a range of aspects, including summary statistics, box plots, line plots, scatter plots, and correlation/regression analysis. The ultimate goal is to evaluate the efficacy of Capomulin compared to other regimens and identify potential factors influencing treatment responses. 

It seems that Capomulin demonstrates consistent efficacy with low mean and median tumor volumes, minimal variability, and a predictable response across mice. Ramicane shows similar results, affirming its effectiveness as well. In contrast, Infubinol and Ceftamin show higher variability and less predictability. Visualizations, including box plots, reinforce the consistent effectiveness of Capomulin and Ramicane. The line plot for Capomulin illustrates a positive response over time, while a scatter plot suggests a correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume.
